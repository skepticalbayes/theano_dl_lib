Basic deep learning models implemented as modules in Theano for plug and play usage

We implimented models for logistic regression, MLP, AutoEncoder and progressively using these modules implimented CNN, 
Stacked Auto Encoders and RNN. 

These implimentations have been executed with modularity in mind so it can be used as sklearn models for peeps 
interested in Deep learning can pick up these models and play around and get accustomed to the idea of neural networks 
skipping the cumbersome implimentation part.
